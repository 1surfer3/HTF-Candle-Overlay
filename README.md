# üöÄ HTF Candles Overlay - Multi-Timeframe Visualization

The **HTF Candles Overlay** is a custom Pine Script indicator for TradingView that superimposes the structure of a selected **Higher Timeframe (HTF)** candle directly onto your current chart.

This tool is essential for traders conducting **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**, providing immediate visual context of HTF support, resistance, and current price range without the need to switch timeframes.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **HTF Structure Overlay:** Visualizes the Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) of a selected timeframe (e.g., 1H, 4H, 1D) using precise boxes and lines.
* **Clear Bias Coloring:** Uses **Blue** for Bullish HTF candles and **Red** for Bearish HTF candles.
* **Real-Time Timer:** Features an optional, customizable label displaying the **time remaining** until the current HTF candle closes, aiding in trade timing.
* **Performance Optimized:** Built with efficient Pine Script v6 drawing methods (`box.new`, array management) to minimize repainting and maximize performance.
